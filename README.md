Quiz #3 (Blackboard)

Exercise #1:

Password Validator

When creating an account, it is often required that the password should fulfil some strength
requirements. It should be X characters long, have at least Y digits, contain underscore, hash, and
a mixture of lower and capital letters, etc. Your task is to write a method that will validate a given
password. The set of rules (requirements) with which you will be verifying the passwords is up to you.

Exercise #2:

Regex

This example requires you to write a method which, given a String, returns a list of all numbers
taken from that String that have 3 or more digits. Table 4.1 gives some examples of expected results
for various input strings.

Expected outputs of regex method:

| Input                     | Expected Output  |
| -------------             | ---------------  |
| abc 12                    |                  |
| cdefg 345 12bb23          | 345              |
| cdefg 345 12bbb33 678tt   | 345, 678         |
